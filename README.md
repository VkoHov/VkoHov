# Vardges Hovhannisyan 👋
**Senior Frontend Engineer (React, TypeScript, Next.js)**  
Product-minded UI • Performance • Testing • Large-data visualization (D3.js)

I build user-centered web applications with a strong focus on **UX clarity** and **engineering quality**.  
I enjoy complex frontend work: large codebases, tricky state, data-heavy UI, and shipping changes safely.

## What I do best
- **Product UI delivery:** turning workflows into simple, reliable experiences  
- **Frontend engineering:** clean architecture, maintainable components, scalable UI systems  
- **Performance:** fast rendering and smooth interactions (including large datasets)  
- **Visualization:** interactive charts and data exploration with **D3.js**  
- **Quality:** tests and confidence in shipping (**Jest**, **React Testing Library**, **Cypress**)  

## Tech
**React • TypeScript • Next.js • D3.js • Redux • MobX • Zustand • Jest/RTL • Cypress**
